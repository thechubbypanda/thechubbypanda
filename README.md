### Hi, I'm Keval 👋😊

- I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer, Computer Science student and Ex Game Developer 😎
- I'm just finishing a year placement at Ocado Technology and in my spare time I'm working on a website and Discord for @UoNCompsoc 🚀
- I'm also trying to learn Kubernetes in my self-hosted home-lab 👨‍💻
- I'm looking for a backend engineering job, preferably specialising in DevOps as it's my passion 🔍

My [website](https://thechubbypanda.net) has links to my socials and a fancy animation (if you have the right browser 🙄).
