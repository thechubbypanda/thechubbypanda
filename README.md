### Hi, I'm Keval ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Engineer with:
- a current DevOps/Cloud Consulting role [@Storm-Reply-UK](https://github.com/Storm-Reply-UK) using AWS, Terraform, Python, React, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.
- a year of DevOps & Tooling experience at Ocado Technology using Python, DotNet, AWS, GitLab, Docker, and more.
- a 1st in my Computer Science Bsc Hons Degree from the University of Nottingham, where I learnt all the fundamentals I could possibly need and made loads of friends along the way.
- a few notable open source code contributions to [docker-mailserver](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver), [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), [authentik](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik) and [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
- an almost annoyingly curious mind which means I have to know how _everything_ works.

I'm currently working on:
- professional work (who could have guessed).
- a more modern and robust version of nextcloud files called [File Depot](https://GitHub.com/thechubbypanda/filedepot) (will be made public soon).
- my [blog](thechubbypanda.dev).
- my Self-Hosted Home Lab.
