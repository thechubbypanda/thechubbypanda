### Hi, I'm Keval ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps & Backend Engineer with:
- a current DevOps/Cloud Consulting role [@Storm-Reply-UK](https://github.com/Storm-Reply-UK) using AWS, Terraform, Python, React Native, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.
- a year of DevOps & Tooling experience at Ocado Technology using Python, DotNet, AWS, GitLab, Docker, and more.
- a 1st class Computer Science Bsc Hons Degree from the University of Nottingham, where I learnt all the fundamentals I could possibly need and made many friends along the way.
- a few notable open source code contributions to [docker-mailserver](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver), [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx), [authentik](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik) and [bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).
- an almost annoyingly curious mind.

I build cool things like [Syncify](https://github.com/thechubbypanda/syncify) and write various ramblings on my [blog/personal website](https://thechubbypanda.dev).
