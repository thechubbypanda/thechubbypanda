### Hi, I'm Keval 👋😊

- I'm a passionate DevOps Engineer and Computer Science student 😎
- I've recently finished a placement year at Ocado Technology
- I'm currently working on a privacy focused "find my phone" app 📱
- I'm also learning Kubernetes and Docker in my self-hosted home-lab 👨‍💻
- I'm looking for a backend engineering job, preferably specialising in DevOps as it's my passion 🔍

My [website](https://thechubbypanda.net) has links to my socials and a fancy animation (if you have the right browser 🙄).
